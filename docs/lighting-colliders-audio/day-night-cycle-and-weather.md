# Environmental Lighting: Day/Night Cycle and Weather Tutorial

## Introduction
In this tutorial world, we’ll explore how to bring your environment to life with **lighting, day/night cycles, and weather systems**. By the end, you’ll know how to:  

- Configure the **Environment Gizmo** to set the atmosphere.  
- Build a **Day/Night Cycle** with smooth transitions.  
- Create **unique islands** with different environmental themes.  
- Add **weather events** for each biome.  
- Build a **Random Weather Cycler** to make the world dynamic.  
- Use the **Lighting Gizmo** for custom lighting.  
- Fun Bonus: Add a **Navigation Beacon** light to guide players in the dark.

## 1. Environment Gizmo Basics

The **Environment Gizmo** controls the overall mood and look of your world.  
You can adjust:  

- **Sky Dome** – Set the background sky color and gradient.
  
- **Fog** – Control density and color for atmospheric depth.  
- **Ambient Light** – Adjust overall brightness and tone.  
- **Horizon Tinting** – Blend the horizon with different moods.  
- **Specular Highlights** – Make surfaces appear shiny or dull.  

We’ll start by experimenting with each parameter so you understand how they affect the world.

## 2. Building a Day/Night Cycle

Next, we’ll use the **Environment Gizmo** to simulate the passage of time:  

- Transition the sky from bright daytime blue to dusk, then to night.  
- Gradually lower ambient light and increase fog for evening.  
- Add stars or moonlight effects for nighttime.  

This cycle will loop continuously to give your world a natural rhythm.

## 3. Creating Themed Islands

To demonstrate how environment settings affect gameplay, we’ll create several **themed islands**, each with unique characteristics:  

- **Desert Island** – Bright sunlight, dry haze, yellow/orange sky tones.  
- **Snowy Island** – Cold bluish sky, high fog density, snowy ground.  
- **Swamp Island** – Dark green fog, low light, eerie mood.  

Each island will showcase how different environment setups create distinct atmospheres.

## 4. Weather Events

Now let’s add **dynamic weather systems** for each island:  

- **Desert** – Sandstorms with heavy dust fog.  
- **Snowy** – Snowfall and blizzards.  
- **Swamp** – Heavy rain and mist.  

Each weather event will be tied to its respective island, giving players an immersive experience.

## 5. Random Weather Cycler

To make the world feel unpredictable, we’ll build a **Random Weather Cycler**:  

- Randomly trigger weather events at timed intervals.  
- Ensure events vary between sunny, cloudy, stormy, etc.  
- Add randomness so no two play sessions feel the same.

## 6. Lighting Gizmo Tutorial

After weather, we’ll explore the **Lighting Gizmo**, which gives more direct control over light sources:  

- Place directional lights (sun/moon).  
- Adjust color, intensity, and shadows.  
- Sync lighting changes with your day/night cycle for realism.

## 7. Navigation Beacon

Finally, we’ll create a **Navigation Beacon**—a light source to guide players at night or in storms.  

- Add a tall light beacon visible from far away.  
- Useful in dark conditions when players need orientation.  
- Helps players locate key areas or objectives.
