### üñºÔ∏è Texture
- Choose a specific sky texture when using **Cubemap** mode.  
- Options include Clear Day, Sunset, Overcast, etc.

### üîÑ Texture Rotation
- Rotates the sky dome around the Y-axis.
- Useful for positioning object in the sky.

### ‚òÄÔ∏è Exposure
- Controls the overall brightness of the environment.
- Lower values = darker tone; higher = brighter scenes.

### üí° Custom Light Intensity
